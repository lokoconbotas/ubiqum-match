Ubiqum Match Exercise

Hi again!!!
We are finishing this week of custom tasks. I hope you are learning and enjoying with this little projects.

Ok this is the last one.
If you remember, in the first task (Bookstore), you must build a site with a lot of instructions. You had the data, the final design, the instructions.
In the second one (Weather) you could let your imagination fly with only the data.
In this last, you will only have the concept.

Ok. You need some things for make this project.

- A JSON with the data: You can access it locally, but I recommend you to get it in remote. With our loved $getJSON :D. In this JSON you need 3 values at least. You are free to make more. This is mine (please don’t copy and paste): https://api.myjson.com/bins/gq4c3 
- A random number between 0 - 100: Every time I click some button, I receive this number and decide if is a match or not. 
- 2 pictures: One for every side. 
- Some function that decide which member is in right side, which in the left and what is their compatibility. 
- All of these points are optional. They are only a little guide to help you, but surprise me!.




Here are some helpful resources.

For create our custom JSON you can use some of these for example.

To upload it to get it from remote, I always use:

To create the avatars or faces you could find a lot of sites like these:
